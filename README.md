The "Space Tag" game is a space-themed adaptation of tag, built with Python and Pygame. Players control a spaceship, competing against an AI opponent to avoid or tag and score points. Featuring smooth movement, intelligent AI, pixel-perfect collision detection, and a modular design, the game includes a main menu, dynamic gameplay, and a game-over screen. This project showcases strong programming skills with potential for expansion through additional features and maps.

Instructions to use the code:
1. open the main.py file
2. run the code with any software that can run any Python code. For example: VS Code
3. after running the code, a screen of the game will be open and there, you can play the game of tag

Note: You will only need to install any software that can run any Python code to play the game.
